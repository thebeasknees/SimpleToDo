## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

An early challenge faced while building the app included targetting Android 12 when building/running the app. I had to change the target SDK from 31 to 30 to fix this issue. Other issues were minor and resulted from rushing through the project, instead of taking my time and having better attention to detail. I also ran into an issue with importing the project code to GitHub, but managed to fix that by generating a token.
